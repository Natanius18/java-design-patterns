# Java Design Patterns

A collection of Java design pattern examples based on materials from [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns).

## Description

This repository contains practical examples of classic design pattern implementations in Java. Each pattern includes detailed explanations, diagrams and working code.

## Repository Structure

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton** - Ensures a class has only one instance
- **Factory Method** - Creates objects without specifying their concrete classes
- **Abstract Factory** - Creates families of related objects
- **Builder** - Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Prototype** - Clones objects

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** - Makes incompatible interfaces compatible
- **Bridge** - Separates abstraction from implementation
- **Composite** - Composes objects into tree structures
- **Decorator** - Adds functionality to objects
- **Facade** - Provides simplified interface to complex subsystem
- **Flyweight** - Efficiently shares common data
- **Proxy** - Controls access to objects

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility** - Passes requests along a chain of handlers
- **Command** - Encapsulates requests as objects
- **Iterator** - Provides sequential access to collection elements
- **Mediator** - Defines object interaction through a mediator
- **Memento** - Saves and restores object state
- **Observer** - Notifies dependent objects about changes
- **State** - Changes object behavior when state changes
- **Strategy** - Defines family of interchangeable algorithms
- **Template Method** - Defines algorithm skeleton
- **Visitor** - Performs operations on objects without changing their classes
